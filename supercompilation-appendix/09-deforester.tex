\section{\texttt{Deforester.hs}}
If we just add \texttt{simplify} (transient edge removal) to the text of \texttt{transform},
we obtain deforestation:
\begin{lstlisting}[name=deforester]
deforest :: Task -> Task
deforest (e, p) =
	residuate $ simplify $ foldTree $ 
		buildFTree (driveMachine p) e

simplify :: Graph Conf -> Graph Conf
simplify (Node e (Decompose ts)) =
	Node e (Decompose $ map simplify ts)
simplify (Node e (Variants cs)) =
	Node e (Variants [(c, simplify t) | (c, t) <- cs])
simplify (Node e (Transient t)) | isBase e t =
	Node e $ Transient $ simplify t
simplify (Node e (Transient t)) =
	simplify t
simplify t = t
\end{lstlisting}
