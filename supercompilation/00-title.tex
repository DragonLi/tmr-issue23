\begin{introduction}
Supercompilation (\emph{supervised compilation}) is a program transformation technique based on
the construction of a \emph{full and self-contained model} of the program.

We illustrate the fundamental ideas and methods of supercompilation with a working
supercompiler called \emph{SC Mini} for a very simple purely functional language.
